## Core Techniques

### Prompt Engineering for Design

**Effective Prompt Structure:**
```
[Style] + [Subject] + [Context] + [Technical Details] + [Mood/Atmosphere]
```

**Example:**
```
"Minimalist vector illustration of a coffee cup, 
clean white background, geometric shapes, 
flat design style, warm and inviting mood"
```

**Best Practices:**
- Be specific about style and medium
- Include technical requirements (resolution, format)
- Describe mood and atmosphere
- Use descriptive adjectives
- Reference artistic movements or known styles

### AI-Assisted Color Theory

**Techniques:**
- **Analogous Harmonies**: Use AI to generate colors adjacent on the color wheel
- **Complementary Contrasts**: AI-suggested opposite color pairings
- **Triadic Schemes**: Three evenly spaced colors with AI refinement
- **Mood-Based Palettes**: Generate colors based on emotional keywords

### Composition Enhancement

**AI-Powered Layout Principles:**
- **Rule of Thirds**: AI analysis of focal points
- **Golden Ratio**: Mathematical precision in layouts
- **Visual Weight**: AI assessment of element balance
- **Flow and Movement**: Guided eye movement through design

### Style Consistency

**Maintaining Brand Cohesion:**
- Create style guides with AI-generated examples
- Use consistent prompt templates
- Develop brand-specific prompt libraries
- Test style variations systematically

## Advanced Techniques

### Multi-Modal AI Design
- Combine text, image, and audio inputs
- Cross-media inspiration and reference
- Unified brand experience across mediums

### Iterative Refinement
- Progressive prompt enhancement
- A/B testing AI-generated variations
- Feedback loop optimization

### Hybrid Workflows
- Combine multiple AI tools strategically
- Manual refinement of AI outputs
- Traditional design principles with AI acceleration

## Technique Application Framework

1. **Define Objective** - What specific design goal are you trying to achieve?
2. **Select Technique** - Choose the most appropriate AI technique
3. **Prepare Inputs** - Craft prompts, gather references, set parameters
4. **Generate Options** - Create multiple variations and iterations
5. **Evaluate Results** - Assess against design criteria and objectives
6. **Refine & Iterate** - Improve based on evaluation feedback
